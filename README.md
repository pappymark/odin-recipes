Hey and Welcome,

Hi this is Mark and this is my first Odin assignment and my first repo in github.
project of course its a recipe page and i made this just today 3/2/2024.
love to share how i made this project. 

a simple html with linked styles.css. all the html in this project use an external css file. exclude recipes.hmtl inside
the recipes directory.about images in this project i didnt donwload the images file but instead i link the url. i use a div for my image container and change the background: url (image). about the p tag i add weight 600 and a line height of 1.5
love to accept suggestion so that i will boost my learning progress.

thank you so much Odin.
